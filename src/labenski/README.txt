This directory contains various source code for handy widgets
distributed by John Labenski, jrl1[at]lehigh[dot]edu, under the
wxWidgets license.

These are distributed by the author in several separate but interdepedent
packages, versioned by release date.  This directory builds them into
a single shared library from a unified hierarchy.  The idea is to try
to change the sources as minimally as possible, to make dropping in a
new release from the author simple.

The doc/ subdirectory includes the original README files from each of the
subpackages.

The following packages and versions are currently included in this
directory:

wxThings      031605
wxSheet       052405
